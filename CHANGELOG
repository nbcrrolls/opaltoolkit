Version 1.9.3:

- Opal Services:
   
   - Fixed a bug where the job status was being retrieved incorrectly
     during a destroy() operation when a database was being used to persist
     state

Version 1.9.2:

- Opal Dashboard:

  - The simple submission form now supports upload of multiple input files

  - The output page after job submission is now opened in a new window

  - The help section of the submission form now displays HTML tags correctly

  - The list of jobs currently running is plotted as a bar graph, with
    different colors for every service

  - Better error reporting if database connection can not be established
    for statistical purposes

  - The summary page now displays the lifetime for the user data to be
    available on the remote cluster (by reading a parameter from the
    opal.properties file)

  - Corrected the "load-on-startup" order of the servlets - an incorrect
    order could potentially cause a database connection error

- Opal Services:
  
  - In earlier versions of Opal, the Tomcat server had to be installed on
    an NFS partition visible to all compute nodes. This is no longer
    required as long as a working directory is NFS mounted, and
    symbolically linked to a location within the Tomcat "webapps" directory

  - Job outputs can optionally be archived by setting a parameter
    (data.archive) inside the opal.properties file

- General:

  - The code should now compile and run with Java 1.4 and older JSP compilers


Version 1.9 alpha:

- Opal Dashboard: it is a web based interface that provide an easy way to check the 
  status of the opal installation 

- If an external database has been used the Dashboard can also display chart with 
  access and usage statistics

- Dynamic Interface Generation for Opal: This web based interface allows user to 
  invoke Opal based service directly from their browser. It is also possible to 
  create customized submission form based on the command line syntax

- Modified and streamlined the install and upgrade process - now bundling
  axis webapp with Opal, thus reducing an external prerequisite
