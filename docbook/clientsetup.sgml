<para>Download the source distribution of Opal2 for installation from
<ulink type="http"
url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=211778&amp;package_id=297015">
here</ulink>, if you don't have the appropriate version already.</para>

<para>Extract the downloaded tarball using the GNU tar utility (or other
similar utilities for Windows), as follows:

<screen>
    tar zxvf opal-ws-$VERSION.tar.gz
</screen>
</para>

<para>This should create a new directory called opal-ws-$VERSION/ where
all the sources are expanded. Henceforth, we refer to this directory as
<emphasis role="italics">OPAL_HOME</emphasis>.</para>

<para>A generic Java client for Opal services is implemented by the
GenericServiceClient class located in $OPAL_HOME/src/edu/sdsc/nbcr/opal. It
lets you run any application exposed as an Opal service, and retrieve its
status and outputs.</para>

<para>To compile the client, perform the following step from inside
the $OPAL_HOME directory.
<screen>
    $ANT_HOME/bin/ant jar
</screen>

<title>Using the Command-line Client</title>

<para>Before running the client, set your classpath using the
etc/classpath.bat|(c)sh script depending on the OS/shell you use - e.g. if you
use tcsh on Unix, set your classpath by typing the following command:
<screen>
    source etc/classpath.sh
</screen>
</para>

<para>To launch a job using the Date service mentioned in
<xref linkend="deploy">, you could use the
following command, which displays the resulting job id, along with the preliminary status.
<screen>
    java edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.GenericServiceClient \
                 -l http://localhost:8080/opal2/services/DateService \
                 -r launchJob \
                 -a \""-v1d -v3m -v0y -v-1d -u"\"
</screen>
</para>

<para>
If your arguments contain characters like "-", you will have to put your
whole set of arguments within quotes that are escaped (\"..\"). If your
arguments don't have special characters like the above, you can simply use
regular quotes ("..").
</para>

<para>You can retrieve job status by running the following command:
<screen>
    java edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.GenericServiceClient \
                 -l http://localhost:8080/opal2/services/DateService \
                 -r queryStatus \
                 -j &lt;job_id&gt;
</screen>
</para>

<para>Once the job has finished executing, you can also retrieve output
metadata using: 
<screen>
    java edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.GenericServiceClient \
                 -l http://localhost:8080/opal2/services/DateService \
                 -r getOutputs \
                 -j &lt;job_id&gt;
</screen>
</para>

<para>You may need to change the above URL if you used a different port, or
are running the client from another machine. Note that you can get the
complete usage information for the client by using the following command:
<screen>
    java edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.GenericServiceClient
