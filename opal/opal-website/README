To generate the web site:
- install maven 2 from the apache web site (maven.apache.org)
- to generate the site from this direcotry issue:
  mvn site
  then you'll find the site in 
  ./target/site/index.html
- to have the authomatic deployment feature working you have 
  to add an entry in the ~/.m2/settings.xml 
  in the servers section 
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>opal.sf.web</id>
      <username>lclement</username>
      <password></password>
      <!-- <privateKey>/home/clem/ssh/id_rsa</privateKey>
      <passphrase></passphrase> -->
      <directoryPermissions>0775</directoryPermissions>
      <filePermissions>0664</filePermissions>
    </server>
  </servers>
  with the right username and password or privateKey and 
  passphrase.
  Then if you issue a 
  mvn site-deploy
  maven will also copy the file to source forge using scp

PS: a good tutorial can be found at: http://www.sonatype.com/book/site-generation.html

  To generate the documentation you also need to install
  OpenJade and to have available jw on you path.
  The documentaion is generated using the script makedocumentatin.sh, this script 
  is called authomatically by maven during the site generation.
  I could be that you also have to modify some path from the DSL file 
  in src/docbook/etc/rocks.dsl at the top of the page, the two path 
  should point to your local installation of OpenJada which is OS dependant
