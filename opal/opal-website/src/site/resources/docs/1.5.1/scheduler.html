<h1>Setting up scheduler support for Opal</h1>

<p>Install a Condor or SGE pool on your compute cluster. Consult the
appropriate documentation for the same. Note that we don't currently stage
and input and output files; hence, the machines should support a shared
file system, such as NFS. Also note that Condor doesn't support parallel
execution using any recent version of MPI. If you plan to configure
parallel execution, use SGE instead.

<p>Access to the schedulers is provided in one of two ways - using the
DRMAA API, or the Globus Toolkit. Depending upon your setup, follow one of
the following two sets of steps. In practice, it is probably easier to set
up access via DRMAA if your scheduler supports the same.

<h2>DRMAA Setup</h2>

<p>1. Ensure that your scheduler supports job submission via the DRMAA API.
 Also ensure that <i>libdrmaa.so</i> is in your library path (by setting
 the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable). We have only tested job
 submissions to SGE 6.x.

<p>2. Set the following properties inside the opal.properties file:
drmaa.use to true, and drmaa.pe to the name of the parallel environment
(PE) to be used to submit parallel jobs. You can ignore drmaa.pe if you do
not plan on supporting parallel jobs. 

<p>3. Reinstall Opal by running the following command:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    ant -f build-opal.xml install
</pre>
</font>

<p>4. Restart Tomcat for the changes to take effect.

<h2>Globus Setup</h2>

<p>1. Install Globus (especially the Globus gatekeeper) on the head node of
the cluster. We use Globus GRAM to communicate programmatically with
Condor/SGE. To enable this, make sure that you have also installed the
Condor/SGE job-manager. Follow the documentation for this on the Globus web
site. You may install any version of Globus as long as you can submit jobs
to Condor/SGE via GRAM (and the Java CoG Kit). We use Globus version 3.2.0
on our cluster.

<p>Ensure that you can submit jobs to Condor/SGE via Globus, especially
using the certificate/key-pair of the Tomcat server (described in <a
href="./security.html">security.html</a>). You can do this by following these
steps:

<ol>
  <li><p>Copy app_service.cert.pem (the certificate file) to
  app_service.all.pem.</li>

  <li><p>Edit app_service.all.pem, and strip out everything excluding the
  region between the lines <tt>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----</tt> and
  <tt>-----END CERTIFICATE-----</tt>. Leave those two lines in.</li>

  <li><p>Append the app_service.privkey (the unencrypted private key) to the
  contents of app_service.all.pem.</li>

  <li><p>Set the X509_USER_PROXY environment variable to the location of
  app_service.all.pem.</li>

  <li><p>Submit a test job using the above proxy to the Condor job-manager as
  follows: <tt>globus-job-run "hostname:2119/jobmanager-condor"
  "/bin/ls"</tt>. If you are using SGE, use
  <tt>"hostname:2119/jobmanager-sge"</tt>.

  <p>If this above job succeeds, then Globus/Condor(SGE) can be used for
  scheduling purposes. You will have to add an entry into the grid-mapfile
  of the Globus installation (usually inside the /etc/grid-security
  directory) to authorize the service to launch jobs as follows:
  <tt>"/C=US/O=grid-devel/OU=sdsc/CN=app_service" app_user</tt>. Replace
  the value within quotes with the DN for the app_service.cert.pem. You can
  get the DN by running: <tt>grid-cert-info -subject -file
  app_service.cert.pem</tt>.

  <p>You may also have to add the CA cert and signing policy of the above
  certificate into the list of trusted certificates for the Globus
  installation (usually inside the /etc/grid-security/certificates
  directory).

  <p>You may also want to check if you can submit parallel jobs via
  Globus. You can do so by running something like this: <tt>globusrun -o -r
  hostname:2119/jobmanager-sge
  "&(executable=&lt;my_mpi_exec&gt;)(count=n)(jobtype=mpi)"</tt>. Replace
  <tt>&lt;my_mpi_exec&gt;</tt> with some valid MPI executable, and replace
  count with a valid number of processes for your executable</li>

</ol>

<p>2. Set the following properties inside the opal.properties file:
drmaa.use to false, globus.use to true, globus.gatekeeper to the URL for
the Globus/Condor(SGE) gatekeeper, globus.service_cert to the location of
the server certificate, globus.service_privkey to the location of the
server's unencrypted private key. If drmaa.use is set to true or globus.use
is set to false, then all Globus specific properties are ignored. 

<p>3. Reinstall Opal by running the following command:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    ant -f build-opal.xml install
</pre>
</font>

<p>4. Restart Tomcat for the changes to take effect.
