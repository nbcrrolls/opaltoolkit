      <p>
 The Grid-based infrastructure enables large-scale scientific applications
 to be run on distributed resources and coupled in innovative ways. However,
 in practice, Grid resources are not very easy to use for the end-users who
 have to learn how to generate security credentials, stage inputs and
 outputs, access Grid-based schedulers, and install complex client software.
 There is an imminent need to provide transparent access to these resources
 so that the end-users are shielded from the complicated details, and free
 to concentrate on their domain science. Scientific applications wrapped as
 Web services alleviate some of these problems by hiding the complexities of
 the back-end security and computational infrastructure, only exposing a
 simple SOAP API that can be accessed programmatically by
 application-specific user interfaces. However, writing the application
 services that access Grid resources can be quite complicated, especially if
 it has to be replicated for every application. Towards that end, we have
 implemented Opal, which is a toolkit for wrapping scientific applications
 as Web services in a matter of hours, providing features such as
 scheduling, standards-based Grid security and data management in an
 easy-to-use and configurable manner.

      <h1>Why Opal?</h1>
      <ul>
	<li>Opal enables deployment of scientific applications as Web
        services without having to write a single line of Web services code</li>
        <li>Opal exposes the scientific functionality through a generic Web
        services API (via a standard WSDL)</li>
        <li>Opal hides the complexity involved in the submission of
        computational jobs to Grid resources</li>
        <li>Opal manages user data, which includes creation of working
        directories, input and output data staging, and persistent storage
        for job information and metadata</li>
	<li>Opal services can be configured with GSI-based security for
        authentication and authorization purposes</li>
	<li>Opal services can be accessed from a multitude of languages
        (Java, Python, Perl, JavaScript) and plaforms (Windows, various
        Unix flavors)</li>
      </ul>

    <section name="News">
        <h1>Opal2 is released</h1>
        <p>We are pleased to announce the availability of the offical release of Oapl Version 2.0.  
        Opal2 is a complete redesign of Opal 1.x with many new features:
        <ul>
            <li>new resource managers can now easily be added using a plug-in based model</li>
            <li>State management is now provided via Hibernate</li>
            <li>the dashboard will work out of the box using the in-memory HSQL database</li>
            <li>WSDL improvements include support for unlimited input file size 
            (SOAP with Attachment), URLs for application inputs, and retrieval of job statistics
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
