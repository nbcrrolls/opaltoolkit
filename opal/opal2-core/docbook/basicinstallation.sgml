<title>Server Prerequisites</title>

<para>Apart from the above packages required for the client, the server also
requires the following packages:</para>

<orderedlist>
   <listitem><para>Tomcat: Tomcat is a servlet container than can be used
   to host Opal Web services. Opal can be deployed inside Tomcat versions
   5.0.30 and 5.5.X. A <ulink type="http"
   url="http://nbcr.net/services/downloads/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.30.tar.gz">cached
   version</ulink> of 5.0.30 may be used, or you may install the binary
   version of Tomcat 5.5.X from <ulink type="http" url=
   "http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">
   http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/</ulink>. Henceforth, for the purposes
   of this reference guide, we will refer to the location of the Tomcat
   installation as <emphasis
   role="italics">CATALINA_HOME</emphasis>.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>The following packages are optional:</para>
<orderedlist>
   <listitem><para>MPI: If you plan to run your application in parallel, you will need
   a version of MPI. You will also need to make sure that your SSH keys are
   set up to be able to run MPI jobs without prompting for a password.</para></listitem>

   <listitem><para>Postgres 8.2.4 (or higher 8.2 flavors): If you plan to
   persist the state of the service in a real database, you will need to install
   Postgres from <ulink type="http"
   url="http://www.postgresql.org/">http://www.postgresql.org/</ulink>. By
   default, we use a Java-based in-memory and disk-based database (<ulink
   url="http://hsqldb.org/">HSQLDB</ulink>)</para></listitem>

   <listitem><para>Scheduler Tools: One way to enable access to schedulers is via the
   <ulink type="http" url="http://www.globus.org">Globus Toolkit</ulink>. The primary
   requirement is that clients must be able to launch jobs on your resource
   using GRAM via the Globus gatekeeper. In addition, jobmanager plugins
   must be available for the particular scheduler that you have installed.
   In other words, GRAM clients must be able to submit jobs to your
   scheduler via the Globus gatekeeper. We have used Globus version 4.0.X
   for our development and testing, but you may use any other version as
   long as the above requirements are met. </para>

   <para>We have used <ulink type="http" url="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor">Condor</ulink> for
   serial jobs only, and <ulink type="http" url="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/">SGE</ulink>
   for serial as well as parallel jobs. Globus jobmanager plugins are
   available for both of the above, and must be installed if you plan to
   use either of them.</para>

   <para>Another alternative to access schedulers is via the <ulink type="http"
   url="http://drmaa.org/">DRMAA</ulink> API. The Web services can submit jobs
   to schedulers as long as they support the DRMAA API. We have only tested
   job submits to SGE via DRMAA.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Create a configuration file for your application. For example, you
can download the <ulink type="http" url="http://pdb2pqr.sourceforge.net/">PDB2PQR</ulink>
program, which is designed to automate many of the common tasks of
preparing structures for continuum electrostatics calculations, by
providing a platform-independent utility for converting protein files in
PDB format to PQR format. A sample configuration file for the same, located
in $OPAL_HOME/configs/pdb2pqr_config.xml, is shown below.

<screen>
&lt;appConfig xmlns="http://nbcr.sdsc.edu/opal/types"
           xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"&gt;
  &lt;metadata appName="PDB2PQR"&gt;
    &lt;usage&gt;
    PDB2PQR is a Python software package that automates many of the common
    tasks of preparing structures for continuum electrostatics
    calculations, providing a platform-independent utility for converting
    protein files in PDB format to PQR format
    &lt;/usage&gt;

    &lt;info xsd:type="xsd:string"&gt;
         python pdb2pqr.py [options] --ff={forcefield} {path} {output-path}
 
         The required arguments are as follows:
	 ...         
         &lt;path&gt;
             The path to the PDB file or an ID to obtain from the PDB archive
         &lt;output-path&gt;
             The desired output name of the PQR file to be generated
         
         Optional command-line arguments are:
         
         --nodebump
             Do not perform the debumping operation
	 ...
     &lt;/info&gt;
  &lt;/metadata&gt;
  &lt;binaryLocation&gt;/Users/sriramkrishnan/bin/pdb2pqr.py&lt;/binaryLocation&gt;
  &lt;defaultArgs&gt;&lt;/defaultArgs&gt;
  &lt;parallel&gt;false&lt;/parallel&gt;
  &lt;validateArgs&gt;false&lt;/validateArgs&gt;
  &lt;jobManagerFQCN&gt;edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.manager.ForkJobManager&lt;/jobManagerFQCN&gt;
&lt;/appConfig&gt;
</screen>
</para>

<para>The configuration consists of a top level element <emphasis
role="italics">appConfig</emphasis>, which contains <emphasis
role="italics">metadata</emphasis>, <emphasis
role="italics">binaryLocation</emphasis>, <emphasis
role="italics">defaultArgs</emphasis>, <emphasis
role="italics">parallel</emphasis>, <emphasis
role="italics">validateArgs</emphasis>, and <emphasis
role="italics">jobManagerFQCN</emphasis> elements. The metadata consists of
<emphasis role="italics">usage</emphasis>, which is a string specifying how
the application is to be invoked, and an array of optional application
information specified as <emphasis role="italics">info</emphasis> elements.
It also contains an optional <emphasis role="italics">types</emphasis>
element, which we can ignore for now (more information about the types
element can be found from our <xref linkend="opalgui-advancedsub"> page).
In the above file, the various options that can be used with the
application are specified within the metadata.</para>

<para>The binaryLocation specifies the location of the application binary -
note that this has to be the location of a <emphasis
role="italics">single</emphasis> executable. No arguments may be specified
here. However, default arguments that need to be used for every run can be
specified inside the defaultArgs element. The parallel element specifies if
an application is parallel or not. The validateArgs and jobManagerFQCN
elements are optional. If set to true, the validateArgs element instructs
Opal to use the optional command-line specification (within types) to
validate arguments prior to execution. The jobManagerFQCN element
over-rides the default job manager, and can be set to the fully qualified
classname of an Opal job manager. By default, the FQCNs for job managers
provided by Opal are
<filename>edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.manager.ForkJobManager</filename> (for basic
fork/system exec),
<filename>edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.manager.DRMAAJobManager</filename> (for
DRMAA), <filename>edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.manager.GlobusJobManager</filename>
(for Globus on a local cluster), and
<filename>edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.manager.RemoteGlobusJobManager</filename> (for
Globus job submissions to a remote cluster). Use the pdb2pqr_config.xml as
a guideline to write configurations for your particular
applications.</para> </listitem>

<listitem><para>Deploy the services inside Tomcat, by changing to the $OPAL_HOME
directory, and running the following command:
<screen>
    $ANT_HOME/bin/ant deploy -DserviceName=&lt;serviceName&gt; -DappConfig=&lt;appConfig&gt;
</screen>
</para>

<para>For example, to deploy the PDB2PQR service, you would type the following
command:
<screen>
    $ANT_HOME/bin/ant deploy -DserviceName=Pdb2pqrServicePort \
                 -DappConfig=$PWD/configs/pdb2pqr_config.xml
</screen>
</para>

<para>Note that you can undeploy your service at any time by running the 
following command:
<screen>
    $ANT_HOME/bin/ant undeploy -DserviceName=&lt;serviceName&gt;
</screen>
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Both the deploy and undeploy targets accept a
<filename>-DappVersion</filename> parameter. If this is used, the service
URL deployed is of the form
<filename>serviceName_appVersion</filename>.</para>

<para>If you plan on using the service with large inputs and outputs, it is a
good idea to increase the heap size being used by the JVM. This can be done
by setting the <emphasis role="italics">JAVA_OPTS</emphasis> environment variable to <emphasis role="italics">-Xmx1024m</emphasis>,
and restarting Tomcat. This increases the heap size to 1GB. If all went
well until this step, the services are running and ready to be used. Test
them by running the client, described in the following section.</para>

<para>The service creates new working directories for every execution. These
working directories are not deleted automatically, so they must be
periodically cleaned up. You may use the script
$OPAL_HOME/etc/cleanup.sh to do so - you will have to modify it to point
to your Tomcat installation (and optionally modify the number of days to
retain scratch directories).</para>

</section>
<section id="client-installation" xreflabel="Client Installation">
<title>Client Installation</title>


<para>A generic Java client is implemented by the class located in 
$OPAL_HOME/src/edu/sdsc/nbcr/opal/GenericServiceClient.java. It lets you
run any application exposed as an Opal service, and retrieve its
status and outputs.</para>

<para>To compile the client, perform the following step from inside
the $OPAL_HOME directory.
<screen>
    $ANT_HOME/bin/ant jar
</screen>
</para>

<para>Before running the client, set your classpath using the
etc/classpath.bat|(c)sh script depending on the OS/shell you use - e.g. if you
use tcsh on Unix, set your classpath by typing the following command:
<screen>
    source etc/classpath.csh
</screen>
</para>

<para>To launch a job using the PDB2PQR service which was described above, you could use the
following command, which displays the resulting job id, along with the preliminary status.
<screen>
    java edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.GenericServiceClient \
                 -l http://localhost:8080/opal2/services/Pdb2pqrServicePort \
                 -r launchJob \
                 -a "--ff=amber sample.pdb output.pqr" \
                 -f samples/sample.pdb
</screen>
</para>

<para>
If your arguments contain characters like "-", you will have to put your
whole set of arguments within quotes ("") and remove the space after the
"-a" above.
</para>

<para>You can retrieve job status by running the following command:
<screen>
    java edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.GenericServiceClient \
                 -l http://localhost:8080/opal2/services/Pdb2pqrServicePort \
                 -r queryStatus \
                 -j &lt;job_id&gt;
</screen>
</para>

<para>Once the job has finished executing, you can also retrieve output metadata using:
<screen>
    java edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.GenericServiceClient \
                 -l http://localhost:8080/opal2/services/Pdb2pqrServicePort \
                 -r getOutputs \
                 -j &lt;job_id&gt;
</screen>
</para>

<para>You may need to change the above URL if you used a different port, or are
running the client from another machine. Note that you can get the complete
usage information for the client by using the following command:
<screen>
   java edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.GenericServiceClient
